1) Can we use React Witout create-react-app  =  Most Probelry No 
   Because for Running React App We need some Setup like = ReactDOM , Babel, WebPack


2) JSX is one Type of JavaScript Object - Browser Read JSX using Transpilor (Babel)


3) Const hame Reasignment of Object se Bachata hai

4) Event Loop - The event loop concept is very simple. Thereâ€™s an endless loop, where the JavaScript engine waits for tasks, 
                executes them and then sleeps, waiting for more tasks.

5) Debouncing - Suppose when user typeying something for search soo when user type complete word then api call and show the result

6) Thortlling - In these case suppose user type one word then api start calling and searching about that one word related product

7) this - this tabhi kaam krta hai jab koi function ho and uske upper uska parent object ho, and usme wo property exisit karti ho.

8) Diffrence Between Promise and async await = Basicallly it's 90% same but, in async/await its wait for the response, when its resolve then it move forward,
   main diffrence is the execution of code.

9) Event Loop - Its checking the callStack everytime , when the callstack is empty , it will take code from task queue and put inside the call stack. 

10) memoization - Here's a simplified explanation of memoization:

When a function is called with certain inputs, the memoization technique checks if the function has already been called with the same inputs before.
If the function has been called before with the same inputs and the result was cached, the cached result is returned instead of executing the function again.
If the function has not been called before with the same inputs, the function is executed, and the result is cached for future use.
The next time the function is called with the same inputs, the cached result is returned directly, avoiding the need to recompute the result.

11) Middleware  -
   applyMiddleware - Dispatch krne se pehle or koi Action ko bhjene se pehle koi event karna hua so tab hum middleware use krte hai
   Redux thunk - Suppose hame dispatch krne se pehle api se koi data catch krna hai uss situation me hum miidleWare ( thunk ) use krte hai

   12) Unidirectional Data Flow - It means we can pass data from parent to child only; and for child to parent we can use Callback functions or Context API or Redux










Currently i have almost 3 years of experience in frontend development , and i have worked on various technologies like Javascript , 
TypeScript , ReactJs, NextJs, Redux, RestFull APi's n all , and my current organization is WealthDesk which is accquired by PhonePe , 
Reason Behind changing is ki Actully they are moving to banglore, and in my case shifting to banglore is not possible , like for some family issue n all , soo..
